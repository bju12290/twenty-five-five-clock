# JavaScript Twenty-Five Five Clock

## Usage

You can play with the application yourself at [this link](https://bju12290.github.io/twenty-five-five-clock/).

This is a simple 25-5 clock, made for tracking the 25-5 minute session/break cycle. Session and break time can both be configured by using the arrows above and below the break length and session numbers. At the end of your session timer, a beep will play signifying that it's time for a break. At the end of the break, another session will immediately start. You can pause and start the timer by pressing the play/pause button. The button will update depending on what action it will perform (play for play, pause for pause). The reset button can be used to reset the timer back to session mode, with whatever the session length is set to. It will also stop the audio from playing if it's playing while clicked.


## Technologies Used
 - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A build tool that offers fast development and optimized production builds for modern web applications.
 - [React](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of dynamic and interactive components.
 - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript. It provides strong type checking, which enhances code quality and maintainability.

 ## Project Structure
 - **'src/'**: At the heart of the application, the **'src/'** directory houses various project assets, the **main.tsx** file for routing, the **App.tsx** component for program functionality and structure definition, the **App.css** file for application-wide styling, and the the **index.css** file for root and body styling.
